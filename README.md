# Welcome to TaniVerse Mobile App 👋

TaniVerse is a mobile app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), using [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) to streamline development.

## 🚀 Get Started

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2️⃣ Start the App

Launch the development server with:

```bash
npx expo start
```

You'll see options to open the app in:

-   [Development Build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
-   [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
-   [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
-   [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) (a lightweight sandbox for trying out Expo apps)

You can begin development by modifying files inside the **app** directory. The project follows [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## 🔄 Reset the Project

Want to start fresh? Run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command moves the starter code to the **app-example** directory and creates a new blank **app** directory for fresh development.
